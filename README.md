The Daily Marmoset
================================

Demo is running at http://phonephreak.net/dailymarmoset/

This is a little Angular app that pulls in article data about Marmosets and displays it.
There's a window width breakpoint at 768px wide, below which the article info is displayed in an Angularized carousel.  Above 768px wide the info is laid out in a vertical stack.

Please refer to the commit history and in the code for comments about the process of putting this together.

Thanks!
